abstract = {This greatly expanded second edition of Survival Analysis- A Self-learning Text provides a highly readable description of state-of-the-art methods of analysis of survival/event-history data. This text is suitable for researchers and statisticians working in the medical and other life sciences as well as statisticians in academia who teach introductory and second-level courses on survival analysis. The second edition continues to use the unique "lecture-book" format of the first (1996) edition with the addition of three new chapters on advanced topics: Chapter 7: Parametric Models Chapter 8: Recurrent events Chapter 9: Competing Risks. Also, the Computer Appendix has been revised to provide step-by-step instructions for using the computer packages STATA (Version 7.0), SAS (Version 8.2), and SPSS (version 11.5) to carry out the procedures presented in the main text. The original six chapters have been modified slightly to expand and clarify aspects of survival analysis in response to suggestions by students, colleagues and reviewers, and to add theoretical background, particularly regarding the formulation of the (partial) likelihood functions for proportional hazards, stratified, and extended Cox regression models David Kleinbaum is Professor of Epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.

abstract = {In order to use environmental models effectively for management and decision-making, it is vital to establish an appropriate level of confidence in their performance. This paper reviews techniques available across various fields for characterising the performance of environmental models with focus on numerical, graphical and qualitative methods. General classes of direct value comparison, coupling real and modelled values, preserving data patterns, indirect metrics based on parameter values, and data transformations are discussed. In practice environmental modelling requires the use and implementation of workflows that combine several methods, tailored to the model purpose and dependent upon the data and information available. A five-step procedure for performance evaluation of models is suggested, with the key elements including: (i) (re)assessment of the model's aim, scale and scope; (ii) characterisation of the data for calibration and testing; (iii) visual and other analysis to detect under- or non-modelled behaviour and to gain an overview of overall performance; (iv) selection of basic performance criteria; and (v) consideration of more advanced methods to handle problems such as systematic divergence between modelled and observed values.},

abstract = {Biotic soil parameters have so far seldom played a role in practical soil assessment and management of grasslands. However, the ongoing reduction of external inputs in agriculture would imply an increasing reliance on ecosystem self-regulating processes. Since soil biota play an important role in these processes and in the provision of ecosystem services, biological soil parameters should be an integral part of soil assessment. The general objective of the current study is to investigate to what extent biotic soil parameters provide additional value in soil quality assessment of grassland on sandy soils. We measured abiotic and biotic soil parameters together with process parameters underlying ecosystem services in 20 permanent production grasslands. Cross-validated stepwise regression was used to identify abiotic and biotic soil parameters that explained the soil ecosystem services soil structure maintenance, water regulation, supply of nutrients, and grassland production, respectively. Process parameters underlying the ecosystem service soil structure maintenance such as bulk density and the percentage of sub-angular blocky elements were mainly influenced by SOM and its qualities. The correlations between penetration resistance at 0–10cm and the percentage of soil crumbs with earthworms suggested a relationship to earthworm activity. Parameters underlying the service of water regulation showed no clear relationship to biotic soil parameters. Water infiltration rate in the field was explained by the penetration resistance at 10–20cm. Process parameters underlying the service of nutrients’ supply such as the potentially mineralizable C and N were mainly determined by soil total N. The potential C and N mineralization were more related to biotic soil parameters, whereby each parameter was the other’s antithesis. The grassland production without N fertilization viz. the nitrogen supply capacity of the soil measured as N yield, was mainly explained by soil organic matter (SOM) and soil moisture, and to a lesser extent by soil total N. One gram of SOM per kg of dry soil corresponded to 3.21kgNyieldha−1, on top of a constant of 15.4kgNha−1. The currently applied calculations in the Dutch grassland fertilization recommendation, underestimated in 85\% of the production grasslands, the measured nitrogen supply capacity of the soil by on average 42kgNha−1 (31\%). This legitimizes additional research to improve the currently applied recommendations for sandy soils. The response of N yield to N fertilization ranged from 35 to 102\%. This wide range emphasizes the importance of a better recommendation base to target N fertilizer. The response of N yield to N fertilization was predicted by the total number of enchytraeids, the underlying mechanism of which needs further investigation on different soil types. This knowledge can be important for the optimal use of fertilizer and its consequences for environmental quality.},

@article{Hanegraaf1998,
abstract = {The Centre for Agriculture and Environment (CLM) has developed ‘environmental performance indicators’ (EPIs) for the nitrogen surplus and the emission of nitrous oxide. The EPI for the nitrogen surplus is an element of the yardstick for mineral accounting while the other is used in the yardstick for energy accounting. The nitrogen surplus is calculated using farm figures for inputs and outputs of nitrogen. For the emission of nitrous oxide from soils, two calculation methods have been developed, i.e. a simple and a complex method. Calculation of both EPIs has been carried out for energy cropping and for dairy farming. For energy crops, nitrogen surplus ranges from 58 kg nitrogen per ha for hemp to 196 kg nitrogen per ha for silage maize (reference crop: 40 kg nitrogen per ha). For the emission of nitrous oxide, both methods lead to similar results, raning from 0.7 kg N2ON per ha for miscanthus to 4.0 kg N2ON per ha for silage maize (reference: 0.9 kg N2ON per ha). For dairy farming, nitrous oxide is emitted directly from fertilisation of soils, including artificial fertiliser and manure, from grazing and indirectly from the purchase of cattle feed cultivated elsewhere. Total emission of nitrous oxide from dairy farms ranges from 3.5 kg N2ON per ha to 18.9 kg N2ON per ha. The major contribution comes from fertilisation, while emissions from urine deposition and purchase of cattle feed only add relatively small amounts. It was concluded that the complex method is more suitable to calculate the emission of nitrous oxide from soils. Mineral and energy accounting show that nitrogen surplus and emissions of nitrous oxide may be substantially reduced by improvements in nitrogen management. More research is needed to assess emission factors for nitrous oxide, and to develop management practices to reduce the emissions.},

abstract = {Extractable Organic N (EON) or Dissolved Organic Nitrogen (DON) pools are often analyzed to predict N mineralisation, N leaching, and to evaluate agricultural (nutrient) management practices. Size and characteristics of both pools, however, are strongly influenced by methodology. Quantifying the influence of methodology can increase the accuracy of soil tests to predict N mineralisation, improve model simulations, and can help to quantify the contribution of the EON and DON pools to soil N cycling. We estimated the relative impact of methodological, management, and environmental factors on EON and DON, using a meta-analysis approach based on 127 studies. Our results indicate that the EON and DON pools are neither similar in size nor controlled by the same factors. The influence of factors controlling EON generally decreased in the order of methodology ($\Delta$10–2400\%), followed by environment ($\Delta$11–270\%) and management ($\Delta$16–77\%). DON concentrations were primarily controlled by management factors: different land use and fertilisation caused a variation of 37–118\%. Seasonal variations in DON concentrations were generally smaller than variations in EON, suggesting that high mineralisation and sorption rates buffer DON. The large range in EON as affected by different methodology emphasizes the importance of using appropriate and standardized methods for the determination of EON. The determination of DON can be useful to estimate leaching losses. EON, however, can be used to assess the impact of soil management practices on the turnover rate of labile soil organic matter pools.},

abstract = {A food web model was used to evaluate the role of soil microorganisms, protozoa and nematodes and their interactions on carbon and nitrogen mineralization in sandy and loamy grassland soils. The differences in C mineralization between the sites did not correspond with the differences in N mineralization. To analyse this discrepancy between the mineralization patterns, C and N mineralization rates were calculated using the observed densities of soil organisms. The C mineralization pattern could be explained from differences in the bacterial biomass estimated on each site. Food web calculations carried out to explain the discrepancy between C and N mineralization patterns indicated that faunal activity played a minor role but that the observed C and N mineralization rates could satisfactorily be calculated using different bacterial C:N ratios as determined for the soil types (8 for the sandy soils; 4.5 and 6 for the loams).},

abstract = {Abstract In this study we propose a multivariate stochastic model for website visit duration, page views, purchase incidence and the sale amount for online retailers. The model is constructed by composition from carefully selected distributions, and involves copula components. It allows for the strong nonlinear relationships between the sales and visit variables to be explored in detail, and can be used to construct sales predictions. The model is readily estimated using maximum likelihood, making it an attractive choice in practice given the large sample sizes that are commonplace in online retail studies. We examine a number of top-ranked U.S. online retailers, and find that the visit duration and the number of pages viewed are both related to sales, but in very different ways for different products. Using Bayesian methodology we show how the model can be extended to a finite mixture model to account for consumer heterogeneity via latent household segmentation. The model can also be adjusted to accommodate a more accurate analysis of online retailers like apple.com that sell products at a very limited number of price points. In a validation study across a range of different websites, we find that the purchase incidence and sales amount are both forecast more accurately using our model, when compared to regression, probit regression, a popular data-mining method and a survival model employed previously in an online retail study.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to test whether soil texture and amount of available carbon affect microbial activity and the percentage of the soil microbial biomass that is active. Total and active microbial biomass were determined by the fumigation-incubation method (FI) and the substrate-induced respiration method (SIR), respectively. The ratio biomass-SIR:biomass-FI, indicating the percentage of active microbial biomass, and the ratio C mineralization: biomass-FI, indicating the activity of the microbial biomass, were both higher in soils with a coarse texture than in soils with a fine texture. The ratio C mineralization :biomass-SIR was not affected by soil texture. The ratios biomass-SIR:biomass-FI and C mineralization : biomass-FI were higher in the upper 10-cm soil layer than in the 10–25 cm layer, while the ratio C mineralization :biomass-SIR was not affected by soil depth. During 25 weeks incubation, the amount of biomass-SIR as well as the C mineralization rate decreased significantly. The amount of biomass-FI, however, did not change significantly during incubation. Assuming that the amount of available C decreases both with soil depth and during incubation, the observations indicate that smaller amounts of available carbon coincide with a reduced activity of the biomass and a lower percentage of active biomass. The close similarity between C mineralization rate and amount of biomass-SIR shows that biomass-SIR is a good indicator of microbial activity, whereas the FI method is not suitable for this purpose.},

abstract = {Soil microorganisms can use a wide range of nitrogen (N) compounds. When organic N sources are degraded, microorganisms can either take up simple organic molecules directly (direct route), or organic N may be mineralized first and taken up in the form of mineral N (mineralization–immobilization– turnover [MIT] route). To determine the importance of the direct route, a microcosm experiment was carried out. Two types of wheat residue were added to soil samples, including younger residue with a carbon (C) to N ratio of 12 and older residue with a C to N ratio of 29. Between days 1 and 4, the gross N mineralization rate reached 8.4 and 4.0 mg N kg1 dry soil day1 in the treatment with younger and older residue, respectively. During the same period, there was no difference in protease activity between the two residue amended treatments. The fact that protease activity was not related to gross N miner- alization, even though the products of protease activity are the substrates for N mineralization, suggests that not all organic molecules released from residue or soil N passed through the soil mineral N pool. In fact, when leucine and glycine were added, only 10 and 53\% of the amino acid-N, respectively, was mineralized. The fraction of N taken up via the direct routewas estimated to be 55 and 62\% for the young and older residue, respectively. After 28 days of incubation, the proportion of amino acid-N mineralized had increased especially in the soil amended with older residue, suggesting that the MIT route became increasingly important. This result is supported by an increase in the activities of enzymes responsible for the intracellular assimilation of ammonium (NH4þ). Our results suggest that in contrast to what is proposed by many models of soil N cycling, both the direct and MIT routes were operative, with the direct route being the preferred route of residue N uptake. The direct route became less important over time and was more important in soil amended with older residue, suggesting that the direct route is favored by lower mineral N availabilities. An important implication of these findings is that when the direct route is dominant, gross N mineralization underestimates the amount of N made available from the residue.},

@article{Reijneveld2014,
abstract = {It is reasonable to expect that compliance with grassland fertilization recommendations in the long run results in optimal soil fertility, and subsequent herbage quality. Here, we evaluate the development of soil, herbage and manure characteristics and their relation over the last decades. We hypothesized that herbage and manure quality are related with soil fertility. We used a large database with results of soil tests, spring forage quality characteristics, and manure analyses, which were made on demand of dairy farmers. We considered the Netherlands as a whole and three selected regions with contrasting soil types (sandy soil, riverine clay, and peaty marine clay). Effects of soil fertility on herbage quality were evident when comparing farms. Farms higher in soil P and K generally have correspondingly higher contents in forage. On average, soil fertility and herbage characteristics were within or just above the agronomical optimal range during the last decades. Herbage crude protein content decreased in all regions during last two decades, which is likely an effect of legislative measures on decreasing the application of N. Selenium (Se) and sulphur (S) contents increased sharply on sandy soils, likely because of increased use of Se and S containing fertilizers. Manure composition did not differ between soil types. In conclusion, at farm level, the element composition of herbage reflected the soil fertility status. The contents of S, P, K, Na, Mg, and Ca in the herbage were all significantly influenced by soil fertility characteristics. Our results emphasize the importance of maintaining soil fertility for high quality roughage production.},

abstract = {Recent legislative restrictions on the use of fertilizers and irrigation, and a quest for sustainable farming systems have drawn renewed attention to the functioning of the soil and the ecosystem services it provides. Soil biota play an important role in the provision of these ecosystem services, which may be influenced by grassland management. The two objectives of this thesis were 1) to gain insight into the effect of different grassland management measures on soil biota in sandy soils; and 2) to explore the effect of grassland management on the ecosystem services provided by soil biota.},
